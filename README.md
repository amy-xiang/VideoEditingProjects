## About

Hello! <br />
I'm Amy, a third year computing science student at the University of Alberta and this is a repository of all the previous video editing projects I've worked on in the past couple of years. I am completely self-taught and enjoy creating these projects either in my spare time or as volunteer opportunities. I mainly use Sony Vegas Pro for my video editing/animations and am currently learning Adobe After Effects. If I need custom assets for my videos, I usually create them through Photoshop, Audacity, Paint Tool Sai, Paint.net or use the talents of other people who are better versed in these areas than I am through the power of the internet. If you would like to know more about how I got into video editing and see my earlier projects, click on the drop down menu!
